# 👑 Hotel Raj Mahal The Palace Website

## ✨ Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive, multi-page, front-end implementation for **Hotel Raj Mahal The Palace**, a luxury heritage resort located in Orchha, India. The primary goal was to create an immersive, visually stunning, and highly functional website that reflects the property's royal and opulent character, while providing a seamless **booking experience**.

The design adheres to a **luxury aesthetic**, utilizing sophisticated typography, gold-tone accents, and modern layout techniques (CSS Grid/Flexbox) to ensure a high-end user experience across all devices.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Luxury UI/UX:** Features a sticky navigation bar, parallax hero section, and a rich color palette (deep gold, ivory, and charcoal) derived from the hotel's brand identity.
* **Dynamic Booking Flow:** Implements a multi-step user journey from the homepage's "Book Now" button through reservation:
    * **Modal Authentication:** JavaScript-driven **Login/Register modals** handle simulated guest authentication.
    * **Advanced Booking Form:** The dedicated `booking.html` page uses **Flatpickr** for date selection and JavaScript for real-time calculation of total charges and taxes based on selected rooms and nights.
    * **Simulated Payment:** A redirect to `payment.html` shows the final amount and a placeholder QR code, simulating a payment gateway step.
    * **Confirmation:** A final confirmation page (`confirmation.html`) simulates a successful reservation.
* **Comprehensive Content:** Includes dedicated sections for **Amenities**, **Location/How to Reach**, **Gallery** with image effects, and detailed **Testimonials**.
* **Dedicated Sub-Pages:** Separate pages are implemented for the **Menu** (`menu.html`) and all three room types (`executive-room.html`, `deluxe-room.html`, `super-deluxe-room.html`).
